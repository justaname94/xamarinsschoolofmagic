# Xamarin API Consume example

Practice on consuming APIs directly from xamarin, using the refit package.
The API use is the one made by myself called 'Dockpad' (WIP), which is a PRM or
personal relationships manager, think of it as a CRM but instead of sales you
manage your relationships and some personal facets of your life. The endpoint
use (subject to change) is one for /activities/ where you manage some
extracurricular activities and (not implemented yet) also with who you do them.

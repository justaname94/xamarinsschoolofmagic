# Xamarin Paint App

## Let's paint something!

This is a cross-platform (am I'm the only one who thinks saying "cross-platform" is really cool?) paint application, some of the main features are.

- Select from 6 different colors! (would have been a breakthrough feature in 1990)
- Undo, redo actions
- Clear the whole canvas.
- Upload your own picture and draw all over it.
- Save your masterpieces to local storage.

And always remember: if the app suddenly crashes, its not a bug, its a feature.

## Images

|                                 Draw anything                                 |                        Draw over images                         |
